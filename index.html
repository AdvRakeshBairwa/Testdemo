        Elon Reeve Musk ( born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor. He
        is the founder, chairman, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO,
        product architect, and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, executive
        chairman, and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company and xAI;
        co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk
        Foundation. He is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an
        estimated net worth of US$190 billion as of March 2024, according to the
        Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $195 billion according to Forbes,
        primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[5][6] A member
        of the wealthy South African Musk family, Elon was born in Pretoria and
        briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada
        at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two
        years later, he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in
        Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and
        received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
        California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after
        two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide
        software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307
        million in 1999, and that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct
        bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
